# CataractT

CataractT is an iOS App that performs image recognition on a persons pupils to determine the presence (or more accurately % possibility) of a cataract.

Although the methods used to identify the cataracts were suggested by an experienced ophthalmologist, this app is not medically accurate and results should always be confirmed by your doctor or ophthalmologist. This was simply built as an undergraduate design project by University of Toronto students (under the supervision of Professor Jonathan Rose) as a proof of concept of the technology.

## Project Overview

Unfortunately we will not be supporting this project any longer, however we have built in quite a features which might be useful as exemplary code for someone looking to do something similar.
